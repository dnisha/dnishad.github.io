Obsidian and Quartz are two different tools that can help you convert Markdown files into HTML and serve them as websites, but they operate in different ways and have distinct purposes.

**Obsedian**

Obsedian is primarily a knowledge management and note-taking app that stores notes in Markdown format. While Obsidian itself does not directly serve HTML from Markdown files, you can use plugins and external tools to publish your Obsidian notes as a website.
